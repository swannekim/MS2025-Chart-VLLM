Describe the shape of the line
representing property investment.

- Newly started property projects, area
The line representing property investment
has a generally downward slope, with some
fluctuations, forming a shape similar to a
wave

Some alternative visualizations include: 1. A
line chart with separate lines for each
category, allowing for a clear comparison of
their trends. 2. A stacked bar chart to show
the combined proportion of respondents in
each category for each time period. 3. A
dual-axis chart to compare the 'Ever done'
category with the 'Past three months'
category on different y-axis scales.",

If you were to create a different
type of chart to represent this
data, what type of chart would
you choose and why?
A line chart would be a suitable
alternative to the bar chart in this
case. It would clearly highlight the
trend in the number of text
messages sent over time and make it
easier to visualize the growth and
decline periods.
The sharp decline in container
transport by rail in Hungary from
2010 to 2012 stands out as an
unusual point. This is particularly
notable considering the overall
increasing trend in transport
volume for Hungary.'
Yes, there seems to be a correlation. Countries
with higher rankings in 'Starting a business'
generally have higher rankings in 'Enforcing
Contract' as well. This suggests that a more
favorable environment for starting a business
may also be linked to a stronger legal framework
for enforcing contracts."

Assuming the trend continues,
what could be the possible
ranking of Covid-19 in
September?
What does the topmost layer
of the chart represent?
The black line experiences
significant drops in power
around March 13th and
March 21st.
If the trend continues, the
ranking of Covid-19 as a cause
of death in Wales could be even
lower than 19th in September.
The topmost layer represents
the combined population of
Asian, American Indian, or
Pacific Islander groups.

Figure 7: Diverse examples from our open-ended instruction-tuning tasks that focuses on the visual attributes of the
chart images which are highlighted in green.
Example Prompt - Generate Instruction-tuning data for Program-Aided Design
Generate numerical and visual question-answer pairs for an LLM that we are trying to tune for Chart Numerical and Visual
Reasoning. Your response should be in a json format where each example has three fields: input: which only asks a
numerical/visual question, program of thought: a python program that can be executed to produce the final answer, and
final answer: which is the final answer to the input question based on the chart image.
For the final answer X, follow the following instructions:
* X should contain as few words as possible.
* Don't paraphrase or reformat the text you see in the image.
* If the final answer has two or more items, provide it in the list format like [1, 2].
* When asked to give a ratio, give out the decimal value like 0.25 instead of 1:4.
* When asked to give a percentage, give out the whole value like 17 instead of decimal
like 0.17%
* Don't include any units in the answer.
* Try to include the full label from the graph when asked about an entity.
Generate ten questions that contain some numerical operations such as, but not limited to, max, min, sum, average,
difference, ratio, median, mode, .. etc. Generate another five questions that not only have numerical operations, but also
some visual aspects such as leftmost, rightmost, top, bottom, middle, peak, colors, .. etc. Generate five simple data
retrieval questions that ask about values, x-labels, or legend labels from the chart. Generate another five yes/no
numerical reasoning questions whose answers must be either Yes or No. Generate another four questions that ask to count
some elements in the chart (e.g., the number of bars/pie slices/colors/x-labels) .
Remember that the program of thought must be an executable python code that solves the question step by step and prints
the answer in the end.

Example Prompt - Generate Instruction-tuning data for Open-ended Tasks
Generate different instruction-tuning tasks for an LLM that we are trying to tune for Chart Understanding. Your response
should be in a json format where each example has three fields: task type, input: which only asks a question or an
instruction related to the task type and the given chart, and expected output: which is the answer to the input
question/instruction based on the input information. Use the following chart image to generate 10 unique tasks

Suggest an alternative way to
visualize the data that could provide
more insight into the walking and
cycling habits across the countries
What are some alternative ways to
visualize this data to highlight the
differences in the trends between the
two categories?
A scatter plot could be used to visualize the
relationship between the proportion of
people who walk or bicycle 'all of the time'
and the proportion of people who walk or
bicycle 'often' for each country. This could
help identify any patterns or correlations
between the two proportions and provide a
more comprehensive understanding of the
walking and cycling habits across different
countries.
