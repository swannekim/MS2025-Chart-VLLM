population is represented as a blue line, while the participation rate is shown as
a brown line. The participation rate is measured as a percentage of the working-
age population.

The chart highlights the key trend of a growing working-age population in Latin
America, while the participation rate continues to rise. This suggests that the
working-age population is aging, while the participation rate is Increasing. This
trend is likely to have significant implicati

The chart also shows that real weekly earnings have been relatively stable in recent years,
with the blue line hovering around 0.3% of the current level. This suggests that the current
level of earnings is close to the long-term average.
Overall, the chart provides a useful overview of the historical trends in real weekly earnings
in the United States. It highlights the impact of recessions and the overall stability of
earnings in recent years.

The chart depicts the year-over-year average hourly earnings growth for CPI adjusted and
CPI unaffected workers from 2000 to 2021. The x-axis represents the years, while the y-axis
represents the percentage of earnings growth. CPI adjusted workers consistently had lower
earnings growth compared to OPI unaffected workers, with a maximum growth of 4.19% in
2000 and a minimum growth of -0.3% in 2020 and 2021. In contrast, CPI unaffected workers
had a maximum growth of 4.5% in 2000 and a minimum growth of -0.3% in 2020 and 2021.
Both groups experienced a downward trend in earnings growth from 2020 to 2021. The
Most significant finding is that CPI adjusted workers consistently had lower earnings growth
compared to CPI unaffected workers, with both groups experiencing a decline in earnings
growth in recent years.

The chart shows the real weekly camings in the United States from 2000 to 2024, adjusted
to today's dollar using the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers, The data is
presented as a line graph, with the blue line representing the CPI-adjusted earnings and the
gray shaded areas representing recessions. The chart also includes a horizontal line at 0.3%
