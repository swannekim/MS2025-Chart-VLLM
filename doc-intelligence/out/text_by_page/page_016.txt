Example Prompt - Evaluating generated summaries
You will be provided with two summaries generated by different models for chart summarization.
Your task is to evaluate each summary based on three key factors:
Informativeness: How much useful and relevant information from the chart does the summary cover? Does it effectively
convey the main trends and insights?
Factual Correctness: How accurate is the summary in reflecting the information presented in the chart?
Structure: How well-structured is the summary? Does it include an introduction, a body with key insights, and a
conclusion?
You are required to assign a score from 1 to 5 for each factor, for each summary. Please provide your ratings in the

' summary 2' : {
' Informativeness' : score,
'Factual Correctness' : score,
