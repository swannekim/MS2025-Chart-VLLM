in 2015. The population peaked at around 600,000 during the Boeing
Boom in the 1960s, before declining slightly during the Boeing Bust in
the 1970s. The population increased again during the Microsoft Boom in
the 1990s and has been steadily increasing ever since. The population of
Seattle reached 704,352 in 2016. The data is based on U.S. Census Bureau

The data table shows the trend of Covid-19 related metrics
from July 2020 to January 2022. It reveals a decline in the
Infection Fatality Rate (IFR) from 80% in July 2020 to 25%
in January 2022. This coincides with a rise in the percentage
of adults who have had Covid, increasing from 10% in July
2020 to 60% in January 2022. The percentage of adults with
antibodies also shows a significant increase, going from 0% in
July 2020 to 100% in January 2022. These trends suggest a
possible correlation between increased exposure to Covid-19
and a lower IFR, likely due to herd immunity and improved
treatment options.
This chart shows the evolution of Covid's infection fatality ratio in Eng-
land, overlaid on levels and sources of immunity. The chart shows that
the Covid infection fatality ratio has decreased significantly since the
beginning of the pandemic. This is likely due to the increasing levels of
immunity in the population, both from vaccination and from infection.
The chart also shows that the Covid infection fatality ratio has been de-
clining at a faster rate since the introduction of vaccines. It also shows
that the most vulnerable groups have been vaccinated and that this has had
a significant impact on reducing the number of deaths from Covid. The
infection fatality ratio has also decreased with the introduction of boosters.
This demonstrates the impact of the vaccine in helping to protect people
from serious illness and death from Covid.

accuracy which are used for instruction-tuning data
generation. These data tables are often incapable of
capturing numerous nuanced details in the complex
charts used in real-world applications (Table 1).
Also, in many scenarios, we are concerned with
representing or understanding general trends in the
charts and not individual data points. On the model
side, existing methods use backbones in which the
vision encoder and LLM are weakly-aligned, ei-
ther due to limited data or architecture, limiting
their generalizability to represent real-world charts.
Instruction-tuning a strongly aligned base VLM
can capture the intricacies among diverse chart ele-
ments and corresponding text more efficiently. We
hypothesize that formulating a simple approach
addressing these drawbacks can lead to an effec-
tive foundation model capable of complex chart
understanding and reasoning in the wild.
We propose ChartGemma, an instruction-tuned
multimodal model for chart understanding and rea-
soning. ChartGemma uses instruction-tuning data
for chart representation learning that is directly
generated from the chart images, capturing more
diverse and relevant information while preserving
complex visual features. This also enables us to uti-
lize a much broader array of charts available across
the web as we are not restricted by the availability
of underlying data tables. ChartGemma develops
The provided data table shows the total number of jobs in the
Bay Area, as well as the number of jobs in San Francisco,
the East Bay, and Santa Clara County, from 2000 to 2026.
Unfortunately, the table only provides data for the year 2000,
with the remaining years missing data for all regions except the
total Bay Area jobs. While we can see the total Bay Area job
growth from 3.3 million in 2000 to a projected 4.0 million in
2026, we lack the specific data to assess job trends within San
The chart shows the job market in the Bay Area from 2000 to 2012. The
Bay Area is approaching its all-time record for total jobs, although Santa
Clara County could be more than a year away before it reaches such lofty
heights. The chart shows that the Bay Area job market experienced a
significant drop during the Great Recession, but has since recovered and
is now at an all-time high. The chart also shows the number of jobs in
different regions of the Bay Area, including San Francisco, East Bay, and
Santa Clara County. The chart is a good indicator of the overall health of
the Bay Area economy.

over PaliGemma (Beyer et al., 2024) which has
been trained on a much larger alignment dataset.
Since ChartGemma uses PaliGemma as its back-
bone, it is also much smaller than existing chart
understanding models, making it suitable for real-
world applications. We evaluate ChartGemma
across 5 benchmarks spanning chart summariza-
tion, question answering, and fact-checking, ob-
taining state-of-the-art results compared to existing
methods. Our qualitative studies also demonstrate
that ChartGemma produces more faithful and re-
alistic summaries of complex charts as compared
to other methods. Through our elaborate analy-
sis, we put forward ChartGemma as an effective
model capable of understanding and reasoning over
real-world charts. Our main contributions are:
· We present ChartGemma, a first-of-its-kind mul-
timodal model instruction-tuned for chart un-
derstanding and reasoning using data directly
generated from chart images.
· ChartGemma utilizes a stronger backbone
model and more representative instruction-
tuning data, rendering it effective in tackling ex-
isting benchmarks across chart summarization,
question answering, and fact-checking while be-
ing significantly smaller than its counterparts.
· Our extensive quantitative and qualitative stud-
